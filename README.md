# NBA_website
Student project as showcase of fullstack programming skills. It's a website containing information about NBA league, it's teams, players, coaches, referees etc. Website is using Oracle database for all mentioned data and PHP database for handling accounts and passwords. A functional login/register system is in place so only 'admins' can login and execute CRUD operations (although, registration is just a showcase, a form where user can create account, without any e-mail confirmation or anything like that). Website is fully responsive with the help of CSS grids. Accounts information are stored in a safe manner with hashed passwords.
